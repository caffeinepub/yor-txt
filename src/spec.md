# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the website/app to "yor txt" across the UI and browser title.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header brand text to display "yor txt" on all pages.
- Update the footer copyright line to "© <current year> yor txt. All rights reserved."
- Replace any remaining user-visible occurrences of the old app name with "yor txt".
- Update the HTML document `<title>` in `frontend/index.html` to use "yor txt".

**User-visible outcome:** The site consistently shows "yor txt" in the header, footer, and browser tab title, with no visible references to the old name.
